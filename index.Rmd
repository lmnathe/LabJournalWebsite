# **Lucas Nathe**

This is a working space for my website. I am currently a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board studying Consumer Finance. 


## What i've been working on lately..
1. Plotting a few google trend search results by DMA against the number of COVID-19 cases by month. [https://lmnathe.shinyapps.io/gtrendsapp/]. Note, the shinyApp currently takes about 30 seconds to launch.
2. A clean function to pull in CRA disclosure files county loan totals.. [https://github.com/lmnathe/read_cra]

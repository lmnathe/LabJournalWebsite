### Resources I Make Use of
1. Link to this website! [https://lmnathe.github.io/LucasNathe/](https://lmnathe.github.io/LucasNathe/)
2. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is great, google will often take you there because someone has already asked your question, and someone else has answered, usually many people have answered your question many ways.
3. Danielle Navarro wrote a [free Psych Stats textbook using R](https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/), it's worth checking out (some of our textbook are based on Danielle's)
4. Daniell Navarro recently made this website for introducing R, it's great, check it out (also made using this R markdown process): [http://compcogscisydney.org/psyr/](http://compcogscisydney.org/psyr/)
5. This is the definitive guide for all things R Markdown (you will find this very useful as you get better at this skill): [https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

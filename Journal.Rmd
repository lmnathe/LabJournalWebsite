### WSJ - ReMarkable2

2022 | 2 | 26 Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

1. I recently purchased an E-reader with a writing capability. In an effort to go more green,
I switched my Wall Street Journal subscription to digital only and wrote a script to auto-login,
download the print edition, and send it to my E-reader through it's API. Check out my work here [https://github.com/lmnathe/WSJ_RM2].

### BJJ

2. After pausing in 2020, I have finally started training in Brazilian Jiu Jitstu again, and found a site that tracks amateur competition records. I've only got 4 matches under my belt but hopefully competing again soon. [https://smoothcomp.com/ko/profile/41099]



### Reading CRA data. 


2019 | 8 | 28 

3. A clean function to pull in CRA disclosure files.. [https://github.com/lmnathe/read_cra]
-There are a few peculiarities regarding reading in the data from 1996-2001, and 2016-2017 that made this challenging, but I believe they are well attended to in this function.

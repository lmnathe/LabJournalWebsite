# Reading CRA data. 

2019 | 8 | 28 Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

1. An clean, yet inefficient, function to pull in CRA disclosure files.. [https://github.com/lmnathe/read_cra]
-There are a few peculiarities regarding reading in the data from 1996-2001, and 2016-2017 that made this chalangeing, but I believe they are well attended to in this function.
